# matchStickProblem

This is a "simple" solver for the "Match Stick" problem meme that was going around, basically it was to make the largest number by simply moving a couple match sticks. There is a lot of variance that could be added to this to closer try match human ingenuity however I didn't go that far at the time of writing as I guess I just wanted it to be done.

I probably would have bothered doing so, if the inbuilt go `image/gif` library was better at handling large files, or there was some sort of webm or apng library I could use. -- Without having to link ffmpeg in directly as that's cgo.
